This project implements a machine learning–based diabetes prediction system using health and lifestyle data from the BRFSS (CDC) dataset. Multiple classification models—including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and MLP (Neural Network)—are trained, evaluated, and compared to identify the most effective predictor.
